# Doomerang
## Summary
You are a cursed boomerang in a world overrun by zombies. Fly through the horde, take out the undead, and keep yourself in the air as long as you can. The more you return, the more destruction you leave behind.

The penguins movement in this minigame is the one I'm using for my game where there is intertia when changing direction mimicking boomerang.
In this minigame, player goal is to collect snowballs by crashing into them, same with my game altough it's to kill zombies.

### Plant vs Zombies

The game will have waves of zombies like plant vs zombies where player (the boomerang) need to clear the wave before the zombies destroyed the gate of the base.
